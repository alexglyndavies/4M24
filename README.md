<h1>4M24 Notebooks</h1> <br/>

These notebooks are designed as a learning tool for the 4M24 module Computational Statistics and Machine learning.  They follow the lectures, providing explaination and implementations of examples in the slides. <br/>

It is stongly encouraged that you clone this Git repository to your own machine, so that you can adapt the code. At the end of some notebooks there are suggestions about parameters that should be changed, to observe the effects they have on the results. <br/>

To clone the repository and use the notebooks, both Git and Jupyter notebooks should be installed.  Download using the following links and follow the instructions if they are not already installed: https://git-scm.com/downloads, https://jupyter.org/install. <br/>

<h2>Cloning the Repository</h2> <br/>

Navigate to the folder you wish to store the notebooks in.  Run the following in the command line: <br/>

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/alexglyndavies/4M24
```

<h2>Using the Notebooks</h2> <br/>
Again, navigate to the folder containing the notebooks and execute the following command in the command line: <br/>

```bash 
jupyter notebook
```

This will start a local server where the notebooks will run from.  The notebooks can now be adapted, added to and saved on your machine. <br/>

For those who have the Python package manager Anaconda installed, you can easily run Jupyter notebooks from the Anaconda-Navigator.
